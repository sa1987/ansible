There are two options that you can add to the [defaults] section of the ansible.cfg file that will control whether or not .retry files are created and where they are created.

[defaults]
...
retry_files_enabled = True  # Create them - the default
retry_files_enabled = False # Do not create them

retry_files_save_path = "~/" # The directory they will go into
                             # (home directory by default)

When Ansible has problems running plays against a host, it will output the name of the host into a file in the user's home directory ending in '.retry'. These are often not used and just cause clutter, is there a way to turn them off or put them in a different directory
